Yeah, this is definitely a heuristic that can get out of sync with
reality. I think in general if you have base pack A and somebody pushes
up B, C, and D in sequence, we're likely to roll up a single DBC (in
that order) pack. Further pushes E, F, G would have newer mtimes. So we
might get GFEDBC directly. Or we might get GFE and DBC, but the former
would still have a newer mtime, so we'd create GFEDBC on the next run.

The issues come from:

  - we are deciding what to roll up based on size. A big push might not
    get rolled up immediately, putting it out-of-sync with the rest of
    the rollups.

  - we are happy to manipulate pack mtimes under the hood as part of the
    freshen_*() code.

I think you probably wouldn't want to use this roll-up strategy all the
time (even though in theory it would eventually roll up to a single good
pack), just because it is based on heuristics like this. You'd want to
occasionally run a "real" repack that does a full traversal, possibly
pruning objects, etc.

And that's how we plan to use it at GitHub. I don't remember how much of
the root problem we've discussed on-list, but the crux of it is:
per-object costs including traversal can get really high on big
repositories. Our shared-storage repo for all torvalds/linux forks is on
the order of 45M objects, and some companies with large and active
private repositories are close to that. Traversing the object graph
takes 15+ minutes (plus another 15 for delta island marking). For busy
repositories, by the time you finish repacking, it's time to start
again. :)
